# List of Components
### Arduino Mega
This card will be the robot's brain. At it will be able to retrieve and process process information. It has 54 input/output pins, some of which provide access to the card's timers, 16 analogue inputs, 4 UART for serial communication. It also USB port for programming and a power supply port (7-12V). Its clock speed is 16Mhz. Finally, it has 256 KB of flash memory.

### Grove module
This Grove module will on top of the Arduino and will useful for simplifying the connecting the various sensors and make the connections more stable. It uses standardised connectors connectors with 4 pins (signal 1, signal 2, VCC and GND). These connect the sensors to digital pins 0 to 21, analogue pins from 0 to 15, as well as 3-pin connectors for servo motors.
